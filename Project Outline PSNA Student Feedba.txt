User Actions: Upvote (👍), Downvote (👎), Comment (💬)
4️⃣ Voting System (Using Cookies)
One vote per user stored in cookies.
5️⃣ Comment System

Upvote/downvote feature for comments.
Backend Features (Spring Boot + Java + MySQL)
1️⃣ User Model (Anonymous or Identified)
Attributes:
id, name, department, isAnonymous
2️⃣ Complaint Model
Attributes:
id, title, description, department, postedBy, createdAt, upvotes, downvotes, comments
3️⃣ Comment Model
Attributes:
id, complaintId, text, postedBy, createdAt, upvotes, downvotes
4️⃣ API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/complaints	Submit new complaint
GET	/complaints	Get all complaints
GET	/complaints/{id}	Get complaint by ID
POST	/complaints/{id}/vote	Upvote/downvote complaint

Comments (weight ×2)
Time decay (older complaints drop)
Low interaction + 30 days = auto-remove
Filtering:
Remove complaints with 60% downvotes.
Remove inactive complaints after 30 days.
3. Integration (Connecting Frontend & Backend)
Frontend → Backend Communication (Axios API Calls)
Fetch complaints from /complaints endpoint.
Submit complaints via POST /complaints.
Send votes via POST /complaints/{id}/vote.
Fetch comments from /complaints/{id}/comments.
4. Deployment Plan
Frontend Deployment
Use Vercel or Netlify for hosting React frontend.
Backend Deployment
Deploy Spring Boot backend using Render, Railway, or AWS.
Host MySQL database on AWS RDS or Railway.
Domain & Hosting
Register a free domain via GitHub Pages or Netlify.
5. Future Enhancements
✅ Admin Panel: Monitor complaints & remove inappropriate content.
✅ Authentication System: Allow login-based voting & complaint submission.
✅ Email Notifications: Notify students when their complaint is addressed.
