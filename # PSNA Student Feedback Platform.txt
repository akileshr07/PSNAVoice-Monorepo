# **PSNA Student Feedback Platform**

## **Problem Statement**
Students in colleges often hesitate to report academic issues, campus facility concerns, or other grievances due to fear or privacy concerns. To address this, we propose the **PSNA Complaints Website**, a digital platform that enables students to voice their complaints openly or anonymously.

## **Platform Features**
‚úÖ **Complaint Submission**: Students can post complaints with their **name and department** or choose to remain **anonymous**.  
‚úÖ **Complaint Feed**: A scrollable list displaying submitted complaints, visible to both students and faculty.  
‚úÖ **Voting System**: Each complaint can be **upvoted (üëç)** or **downvoted (üëé)** (one vote per user) to highlight important issues.  
‚úÖ **Comment Section**: Users can engage in discussions through comments.  
‚úÖ **Sorting Mechanism**: Complaints with the most **upvotes and comments** appear at the top.  
‚úÖ **Navigation Bar**: Includes the website title **"PSNA Complaints"**, a **mock college logo**, and a **"Post Complaint"** button in the top-right corner for submitting new complaints.

## **Sorting Algorithm**
A **customized version of Reddit's Hot Ranking Algorithm** with added rules to **remove low-quality complaints**.

### **Key Sorting & Filtering Rules**
1. **Prioritize complaints with high upvotes** (more support = higher ranking).
2. **Give preference to recent complaints** (newer posts appear first).
3. **If (downvotes ‚â• 60% of total votes), remove the complaint**.
4. **If a post has very low interaction (few votes & comments) and is older than 30 days, remove it**.

### **Sorting Formula:**
\[
score = (upvotes - downvotes) + (comments \times 2) + \frac{100}{age\ in\ hours + 2}
\]

### **How It Works:**
- **More upvotes increase the ranking**.
- **Comments have weight (√ó2) to promote discussions**.
- **Recent posts get a boost, but older posts decay gradually**.
- **Older posts with little interaction are removed automatically**.
- **Posts with too many downvotes (‚â• 60% of total votes) are dumped**.

### **Filtering Rules**
#### **1. Remove Highly Downvoted Complaints**
\[
if\ \left(\frac{downvotes}{upvotes + downvotes} \geq 0.6\right) \Rightarrow \text{REMOVE post}
\]
‚û°Ô∏è If **60% or more votes are downvotes**, remove the complaint.

#### **2. Remove Old, Inactive Complaints**
\[
if\ (total\ votes + comments < 5)\ \text{AND}\ (post\ age > 30\ days) \Rightarrow \text{REMOVE post}
\]
‚û°Ô∏è If a post has **very low interaction** (less than 5 votes/comments combined) and is **older than 30 days**, remove it.

## **Voting System Implementation**
### **Using Browser Cookies (Simple & Lightweight Approach)**
- When a user votes on a post (upvote/downvote), store their vote in a **cookie**.
- The cookie contains **post ID** and **vote type**.
- If the user tries to vote again on the same post, **check the cookie and prevent multiple votes**.

üü¢ **Pros:**
- No login required.
- Works across browser sessions (until cookie expires).

üî¥ **Cons:**
- Users can clear cookies and vote again.
- Not effective for users in incognito mode or switching browsers.

---
## **Post Layout (Feed Section)**
### **Header (Small Font, Light Gray Color)**
- Displays **posting user's name** (optional for anonymity).
- **Time stamp** (e.g., "5 hr ago", "1 hour ago", "Just now")‚Äîsimilar to YouTube.
- **Department or Custom Category** (e.g., "To: ECE, CSE, IT, College Management").

### **Title (Bold Font, Larger Size)**
- If provided, appears in **bold**.
- Helps grab attention and improve readability.

### **Content (Slightly Bold, Regular Font Size)**
- Complaint details appear in a slightly lighter **bold** font.

### **Interaction Elements (Small Icons/Text)**
- **Upvote & Downvote:** One vote per user.
- **Comment Section:** "Add a Comment" button + comment count indicator (e.g., "18 comments").
- **Share Button:** Allows users to share complaint links.
